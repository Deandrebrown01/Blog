## Wall-E ##

The role of AI in Wall-E is that human beings are reliant on it throughout the movie. In addition, they are portrayed as being servants and they cater to the people living on the ship. For example, on the ship, AI is seen doing everyday tasks for humans such as transportation (walking too), dietary needs, and tending to their every need. They were so dependent on AI (because of how much AI was doing everything for them) that they gained weight and became lazy to the point where they could not even walk when they got off their seats.


The ethical considerations in Wall-E regarding AI and technology are security and misinformation. There are ethical dilemmas of AI actions such as misinformation and bias. These issues relate to real-world AI ethics because even in the real world AI is sometimes used heavily, especially for serious situations. This can lead to misinformation and problems because AI sometimes isn't correct 100 percent of the time.







The interaction between humans and the AI characters in Wall-E is are they are more sentient in the movie catering to the human's every need. In addition, it is shown that humans are dependent on AI constantly. The film shows the potential for human AI bonds by showing us how much we already depend on AI and if we depend on it too much what direction we can steer in as a society.







The movie envisions the future of society concerning AI technology as lethargic to whatever happens to us as a society and vulnerable to AI. The benefits of a society being heavily reliant on AI are that tasks can be done efficiently and gives us new ideas. The drawbacks are that it makes us lazy, can lessen employment, and could make us vulnerable to the point where we can do anything because AI says so.
