## My First Project ##

In my first project I did we had to make a list. First, we opened visual studio code and made a todo python file. Then, I named my list a variable called Todos. I made a lot of mistakes that led to me finally able to do it correctly.
 
 Due to me learning from my mistakes, I started with a while loop because since it is a list it has to go on forever. After I indented,so my whole code could go in the while loop. I then proceeded to name a variable named remove, which asked the user if they wanted to remove or add something to the list. Ex:Remove=input("Would you like to add or remove something"). 
 
 After I made it print the list out so the user can see what is in the list.Then, depending on if they want to remove or add something. In the project I also included a true statement so that way my code will work.
