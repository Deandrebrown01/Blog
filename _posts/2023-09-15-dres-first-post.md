## My Summer and upcoming goals##

My summer went super exicting. I got to go out thrifting and travel most of the time. Some places I went are Philly and Mexico. I went to the gym and stayed out late. My goals that I have so far been doing well with is self care, going to the gym, eating healthy, and doing whatever I have to do to stay focused and successful. I am excited for this year especially because I've been doing good with my goals. I am getting my braces off, going to my best friends homecoming and being her date, going out for halloween again, my birthday and christmas.
