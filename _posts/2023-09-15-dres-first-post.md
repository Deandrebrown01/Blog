## My Summer and upcoming goals ##

My summer went super exciting. I got to go out thrifting and travel most of the time. Some places I went to are Philly and Mexico. I went to the gym and stayed out late. My goals that I have so far been doing well with are self-care, going to the gym, eating healthy, and doing whatever I have to do to stay focused and successful. I am excited for this year especially because I've been doing good with my goals. I am going to work out more than I have before. My two goals are to also learn how to skateboard again because I broke my skateboard and I lowkey am rusty. Lastly, I want to learn how to play the guitar again cause I am a little rusty with that too.  I am also getting my braces off, going to my best friend's homecoming and being her date, and going out for Halloween again. I am also excited for my birthday (December 8th )and Christmas because I love the feeling of Christmas whether it is the snow or the movies. I also like going out on Christmas/Eve, hanging out with my family, and drinking hot chocolate/water while eating food.
